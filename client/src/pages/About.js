        The natural right of a person to own property as a concept can be seen
        as having roots in Roman law as well as Greek philosophy. The profession
        of appraisal can be seen as beginning in England during the 1500s as
        agricultural needs required land clearing and land preparation.
        Textbooks on the subject of surveying began to be written and the term
        "surveying" was used in England, while the term "appraising" was more
        used in North America. Natural law which can be seen as "universal law"
        was discussed among writers of the 15th and 16th century as it pertained
        to "property theory" and the inter-state relations dealing with foreign
        investments and the protection of citizens private property abroad.
        Natural law can be seen as having an influence in Emerich de Vattel's
        1758 treatise The Law of Nations which conceptualized the idea of
        private property.

        One of the largest initial real estate deals in history known as the
        "Louisiana Purchase" happened in 1803 when the Louisiana Purchase Treaty
        was signed. This treaty paved the way for western expansion and made the
        U.S. the owners of the "Louisiana Territory" as the land was bought from
        France for fifteen million, making each acre roughly 4 cents. The oldest
        real estate brokerage firm was established in 1855 in Chicago, Illinois,
        and was initially known as "L. D. Olmsted & Co." but is now known as
        "Baird & Warner". In 1908, the National Association of Realtors was
        founded in Chicago and in 1916, the name was changed to the National
        Association of Real Estate Boards and this was also when the term
        "realtor" was coined to identify real estate professionals.
